# Changelog

## Proposal 27241

* Display the payloads of 'Execute NNS Function' proposals
* Allow markdown in proposal summaries
* Display the new 'title' field on proposals
* Add a `metrics` endpoint for creating dashboards on Prometheus.
* Fetch accounts, balances, and neurons more securely. Rather than fetching sensitive data (e.g. ledger balances) as query calls, we now fetch the data twice in parallel: once as a query call for UI snappiness, and another as an update call to get a certified response. The certified response overwrites the result of the query.
* Ledger wallet: Allow disbursing neurons to a different account.
* Minor UI enhancements.
