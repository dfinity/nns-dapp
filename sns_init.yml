# This field sets the initial token distribution. Initially, there is only support for

#
# - developer_distribution has one field:
#    - developer_neurons: A map between PrincipalId and u64, it specifies the neuron stake and
#      controlling principal of developer neurons available at genesis.
#
# - treasury_distribution has two fields:
#    - total_e8s: The total amount of tokens in the treasury bucket. Airdrops will be deducted from
#      this total.
#    - airdrop_neurons: A map between PrincipalId and u64, it specifies the neuron stake and
#      controlling principal of airdropped neurons available at genesis.
#
# - swap_distribution has two fields:
#    - total_e8s: The total amount of tokens in the swap bucket. initial_swap_amount_e8s will be
#      deducted from this total.
#    - initial_swap_amount_e8s: The initial amount of tokens deposited in the swap canister for
#      the initial token swap.
