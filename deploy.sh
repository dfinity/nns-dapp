	Deploys the nns-dapp or internet identity to a network.

	This file will recreate the arguments file and override it.

	If you want to use a custom arguments file, use dfx directly.

	Usage:

	Preflight: Make sure that you can run build.sh before using deploy.sh.  The build
	  script requires a number of dependencies.  If you cannot run "build.sh" then
	  "dfx deploy" will fail. To check, run:  DFX_NETWORK=mainnet build.sh

	./deploy.sh --nns-dapp <network>
	  Deploys nns-dapp to the selected network. The default is "local".

	The available networks are the ones listed in dfx.json.
