name: Reproducible Docker Builds
# Simulates end users verifying builds published by Dfinity:
# - Runs docker builds on various different operating systems, with an empty docker cache.
#   Note: This makes builds slow but is more representative of the end user experience.
# - Verifies that all these builds yield the same artifacts.
# - NOT DONE: Verify that these builds match our release artifacts.  This would correspond to third
#   party verifiers getting consistent hashes that differ from our release.
