            # Motivation
            We would like to parse all the latest SNS data. To do so, we update the candid interfaces for the SNS aggregator.
            Even with no changes, just updating the reference is good practice.

            # Changes
            * Updated the Rust code derived from `.did` files in the aggregator.
              * Note: The candid files under `declarations/nns-$CANISTER` are used as inputs.

            # Tests
              - [ ] Please check the API updates for any breaking changes that affect our code.
              Breaking changes are:
                * New mandatory fields
                * Removing mandatory fields
                * Renaming fields
                * Changing the type of a field
                * Adding new variants
