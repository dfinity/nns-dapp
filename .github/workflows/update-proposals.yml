            # Motivation
            We would like to render all the latest proposal types.
            Even with no changes, just updating the reference is good practice.

            # Changes
            * Updated the Rust code derived from `.did` files in the proposals payload rendering crate.
              * Note: The candid files under `declarations/nns-$CANISTER` are used as inputs.

            # Tests
              - [ ] Please check the API updates for any breaking changes that affect our code.
              - [ ] Please check for new proposal types and add tests for them.

            Breaking changes are:
              * New mandatory fields
                * Removing mandatory fields
                * Renaming fields
                * Changing the type of a field
                * Adding new variants
