            # Motivation
            We would like to render all the latest proposal types.
            Even with no changes, just updating the reference is good practice.

            # Changes
            * Update the version of `IC_COMMIT_FOR_PROPOSALS` specified in `dfx.json`.
            * Updated the `proposals` candid files to the versions in that commit.
            * Updated the Rust code derived from `.did` files in the proposals payload rendering crate.

            # Tests
              - [ ] Please check the API updates for any breaking changes that affect our code.
              - [ ] Please check for new proposal types and add tests for them.

            Breaking changes are:
              * New mandatory fields
                * Removing mandatory fields
                * Renaming fields
                * Changing the type of a field
                * Adding new variants
