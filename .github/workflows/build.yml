# A Native build
# XXX: This makes some of 'checks.yml' redundant. This will be fixed as soon as
# we have end-to-end tests working.
# https://dfinity.atlassian.net/browse/L2-191
name: Native build
# We use "push" events so that we have the actual commit. In "pull_request"
# events we get a merge commit with main instead. The merge commit can be
# useful to check that the code would pass tests once merged, but here it just
# creates confusion and doesn't add anything since the branch must be up to
# date before merge. It's also nice to have CI running on branches without PRs.

      # GitHub actions won't (re-)upload the cache after the build, it means that
