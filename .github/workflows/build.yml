# We use "push" events so that we have the actual commit. In "pull_request"
# events we get a merge commit with main instead. The merge commit can be
# useful to check that the code would pass tests once merged, but here it just
# creates confusion and doesn't add anything since the branch must be up to
# date before merge. It's also nice to have CI running on branches without PRs.
