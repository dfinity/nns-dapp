# chrono 0.4.19 has vulnerabilities fixed in 0.4.20
# but, 0.4.20 doesn't satisfy ic. We get the followig error when deploying the canister:
# The Replica returned an error: code 5, message: "Wasm module of canister vo5te-2aaaa-aaaaa-aaazq-cai is not valid: Wasm module has an invalid import section. Module imports function '__wbindgen_describe' from '__wbindgen_placeholder__' that is not exported by the runtime."
# 0.4.19 works and satisfies ic.
