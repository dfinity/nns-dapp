	  <h1>SNS aggregator</h1>
	  <p>The aggregator collects information on all deployed SNS and re-publishes aggegate values as certified query calls.  This data is intended for use by any canister that wishes to provide dashboards.  The data will typically be updated about once per minute.  Collecting the data from this aggregator will typically be much faster than collecting the same data directly from the SNSs.</p>
