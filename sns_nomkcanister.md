# Retract permission for the GIX team to create canisters on the SNS subnet

The GIX team has no further need to create canisters on the SNS subnet at this time.  We would like to be relieved
of the power, and responsibility, of being able to create such canisters.

## Context
The GIX team previously requested and received permission to create canisters on the SNS subnet.
This was done in order to improve user experience under load and the ability of the SNS infrastructure to scale.

The primary canister, that aggregates data across SNSs, has been deployed.  There is no need at this time to create
more canisters.

There is also a wallet canister and several empty canisters.  Once upgrades of the aggregator by proposal have
been tested unused canisters will be deleted.

The principal that the GIX team use is: wgfa2-l65ry-bjl6l-idehu-56rsz-srpsc-km5fe-jgglp-p5up7-npbep-5ae
