    "NeuronManagement": "A special topic by means of which a neuron can be managed by the followees for this topic (in this case, there is no fallback to default). Votes on this topic are not included in the voting history of the neuron. For proposals on this topic, only the neuron’s followees on the topic that the proposals pertain to are allowed to vote. Because the set of eligible voters of proposals on this topic is restricted, proposals on this topic have a shorter than normal voting period.",
    "ExchangeRate": "All proposals provide information in “real time” about the market value of ICP, as measured by an International Monetary Fund (IMF) Special Drawing Right (SDR) , which allows the NNS to convert ICP to cycles (which power computation) at a rate that keeps their real-world cost constant. Because proposals on this topic are very frequent, they have a shorter voting period, and votes on this topic are not included in the voting history of the neuron.",
    "NetworkEconomics": "Proposals that administer network economics — for example, determining what rewards should be paid to node providers.",
    "Governance": "All proposals that administer governance — for example, motions and the configuration of certain parameters.",
    "NodeAdmin": "All proposals that administer node machines somehow, including but not limited to upgrading or configuring the OS, upgrading or configuring the virtual machine framework, and upgrading or configuring the node replica software.",
    "ParticipantManagement": "All proposals that administer network participants — for example, granting and revoking DCIDs (data center identities) or NOIDs (node operator identities).",
    "SubnetManagement": "All proposals that administer network subnets — for example, creating new subnets, adding and removing subnet nodes, and splitting subnets.",
    "NetworkCanisterManagement": "All proposals to manage NNS-controlled canisters not covered by other topics (Protocol Canister Management or Service Nervous System Management).",
    "Kyc": "Proposals that update KYC information for regulatory purposes — for example, during the initial Genesis distribution of ICP in the form of neurons.",
    "NodeProviderRewards": "Topic for proposals to reward node providers.",
    "SnsDecentralizationSale": "SNS Decentralization Swap.",
    "IcOsVersionElection": "Proposals handling election of IC OS versions.",

    "ProtocolCanisterManagement": "All proposals to manage protocol canisters, which are considered part of the ICP protocol and are essential for its proper functioning.",
    "ServiceNervousSystemManagement": "All proposals to manage the canisters of service nervous systems (SNS), including upgrading relevant canisters and managing SNS framework canister WASMs through SNS-W."
