/**
 * A store to handle the current route ("which page to display").
 * - update: update the state value
 * - navigate: update the state value and push the new route to the browser history i.e. update browser url with an entry in the navigation stack
 * - replace: update the state value and replace the route in the browser history i.e. update browser url without modifying the navigation stack
 *
 * The store contains following information:
 * - path: the application path - i.e. the page (see AppPath) that is displayed
 * - referrerPath: the page - i.e. the path - that linked to the current path. For example, if navigating from "Accounts" to "Voting" page, the referrerPath is `/#/accounts`. If the referrer is not the app, then is value is undefined.
 * - isKnownPath: tells if the path is a path that is supported by the app
 *  - currently is used to imitate the flutter dapp navigation (redirects the user to the first page "/accounts/")
 *  - later could be used to display a 404
 *
