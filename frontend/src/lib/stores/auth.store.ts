/**
 * A store to handle authentication and the identity of the user.
 *
 * - sync: query auth-client to get the status of the authentication
 * a. if authenticated only, set identity in the global state
 * b. if not authenticated, set null in store
 *
 * the sync function is performed when the app boots and on any change in the local storage (see <Guard/>)
 *
 * note: auth-client is initialized with an anonymous principal. By querying "isAuthenticated", the library checks for a valid chain and also that the principal is not anonymous.
 *
 * - signIn: log in method flow. started with a user interaction ("click on a button")
 *
 * - signOut: call auth-client log out and set null in the store. started with a user interaction ("click on a button")
 *
 * note: clearing idb auth keys does not happen in the state management but afterwards in its caller function (see <Logout/>)
