// HACK:
//
// 1. the governance canister does not implement a filter to hide proposals where all neurons have voted or are ineligible.
// 2. the governance canister interprets queries with empty filter (e.g. topics=[]) has "any" queries and returns proposals anyway. On the contrary, the Flutter app displays nothing if one filter is empty.
// 3. the Flutter app does not simply display nothing when a filter is empty but re-filter the results provided by the backend.
//
// In addition, we have implemented an "optimistic voting" feature.
//
// That's why we hide and re-process these proposals delivered by the backend on the client side.
