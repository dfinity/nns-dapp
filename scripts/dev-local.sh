#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script aims to hold the user by the hand to get a local development
# setup working. It's not meant to be suitable to use every time as it would
# force you to take all steps from scratch.
#
# Once you have a replica with nns-dapp and your node modules installed, then
# next time you can simply run `npm run dev` from the frontend directory.
#
# With this setup, you can work on the frontend code without building the
# nns-dapp canister. If you want to change the backend code, you can deploy it
# with `dfx deploy nns-dapp` and it replace the provided canister.
