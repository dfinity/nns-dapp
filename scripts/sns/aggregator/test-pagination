	Tests that SNSs can be obtained without error from the aggregator.

	Prerequisites:
	 * The aggregator has been installed.
	 * The aggregator has had time to populate its cache, so all data should be present and correct.
	 * No new SNSs are being added, as this could cause a race condition when checking
	   the number of SNSs against the "latest" endpoint.
