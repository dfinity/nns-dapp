	Compiles a did file to Rust and applies any saved manual changes.

	Usage: $(basename "$0") <CANISTER_NAME>

	Hint: To create a patchfile:
	  - Customise the built rust file to your heart's content.
	  - Commit the modified file.
	  - Remove any existing patchfile.
	  - Make a clean build (this will undo your changes)
	  - Run: git diff -R \$CANISTER_NAME.rs > \CANISTER_NAME.patch
	  - Check out the rust file to recover your changes.
	  - Now, rebuilding should create a file with your changes.

  # didc converts the .did to Rust, with the following limitations:
  #   - It applies the canidid Deserialize trait to all the types but not other traits that we need.
  #   - It makes almost all the types and fields private, which is not very helpful.
  #
  # sed:
  #   - Comments out the header provided by didc; we provide our own and the two conflict.
  #   - Makes structures and their fields "pub", so that they can be used.
  #   - Adds additional traits after "Deserialize".
  #   - Makes API call response types "CallResult".  The alternative convention is to have:
  #       use ic_cdk::api::call::CallResult as Result;
  #     at the top of the rust file but that is both confusing for Rust developers and conflicts
  #     with custom definitions of Result found in some did files.
  #   - didc creates invalid Rust enum entries of the form: `StopDissolving{},`
  #     These are changed to legal Rust: `StopDissolving(EmptyRecord),`
  #     where "EmptyRecord" is defined as the name suggests.
  #   - Deprecated: Uses `candid::Principal` instead of `Principal`.
  #   - Change creating callback types with `candid::define_function!` to `pub type ... = candid::Func;`
  #
  # Final tweaks are defined manually and encoded as patch files.  The changes typically include:
  #   - Replacing the anonymous result{} type in enums with EmptyRecord.  didc produces valid rust code, but
  #     in a form that the Candid macro cannot handle.  Using a named type works around the limit of the macro.
  #   - We need a few but not all of the types to have the Default macro
  #   - Any corrections to the output of the sed script.  sed is not a Rust parser; the sed output
  #     is not guaranteed to be correct.
