	Runs a local replica with state as saved by 
  https://github.com/dfinity/snsdemo/blob/main/bin/dfx-state-save .
  Then it runs a local frontend and waits for the user to interact with it.
  When the user is done, the script stops the replica and restores original the
  state.

  The script replaces existing dfx directories after moving them to a backup.
  So if things go wrong this is potentially dangerous for your dfx state.
  A restore scripts is placed in the backup directory, which might be helpful in
  such cases.
