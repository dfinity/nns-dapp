# Unreleased changelog NNS Dapp

Introduction unreleased...

## Unreleased

### Application

#### Added

* Periodically check for new transactions and updated balances of the SNS tokens/accounts.
* Decode the payment (amount) from the QR code reader.
* Add "Select All" and "Clear" selection in proposal filters.
* Add vesting information in SNS neuron detail.
* Render SNS neuron voting power in neuron detail page.

#### Changed

* Simplify rust cache expiry with \`pop_first()\`.
* Disable functionality buttons while SNS neuron is vesting.
* Updated \`bitcoin-canister\` revision for proposal payload support.
* Ignore sign-in "error" \`UserInterrupt\`.

#### Deprecated

* Web Workers have been migrated to ES modules, which means that Firefox users using versions [prior to v114](https://caniuse.com/?search=worker%20module) won't be able to read certain data in the UI, such as TVL and canisters' cycles, unless they upgrade their browser to a more recent release.

#### Removed
#### Fixed

* Enable voting for proposals that are decided but still accepting votes.
* Misplaced tooltip for disabled SNS neuron split button.
* Fix bug with newly created canisters where the name was ovewritten to empty string.

#### Security
#### Not Published

* Progress on merge neurons preview, behind a flag.

### Operations

#### Added
- A script to get the WASM hash from the GitHub CI build log.
- CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal support.
- Base64 image support for payload rendering.
- \`scripts/canister_ids\` can now remove canisters from \`canister_ids.json\`.

* Added a command to inspect canister upgrade proposals. (See: scripts/dfx-nns-proposal-args)

#### Changed
- Consolidated the config tests.
- Made per-network configuration in dfx.json optional.
- Consolidated the \`docker-build\` and \`aggregator\` GitHub workflows into the \`build\` workflow, to reuse the build artefacts and so reduce network load on the runners.
- Increased timeout on end-to-end tests running on CI.
- Set a custom URL for \`internet_identity\` on \`ic\` rather than using the default.
- Improve Canister Detail tests by mocking the api layer instead of services.
- Copied the newest version of clap.bash from snsdemo.

#### Deprecated
#### Removed
- Deleted the now empty \`docker-build\` and \`aggregator\` GitHub workflows.
#### Fixed
- Script to download WASM from CI no longer relies on broken \`gh --status\` flag.
* ci-link script uses correct workflow name.
